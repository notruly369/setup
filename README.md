## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you are familiar with the basics of D&D. If you need a quick refresher, check out the [Player's Handbook](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook).

You'll also need to get a character ready. For that, you can use the official [D&D Character Builder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/builder#/), or if you prefer pen and paper, you can download a [Character Sheet](https://dnd.wizards.com/charactersheets) to fill out manually.

## Schedule

Our game will run every Sunday, starting from the 18th of June. Sessions will run from 7 PM to 9 PM. 

## Communication

We will use Discord for our game sessions. If you don't have a Discord account yet, you can sign up for one [here](https://discord.com/register). Please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JKrPejPg)
## Tools

We'll be using [Roll20](https://roll20.net/) for our maps and dice rolls. Please make sure you have an account and are familiar with the basics of the tool. You can find tutorials [here](https://roll20.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002582973-Getting-Started).
